# File Extension Mover
A tkinter GUI application built with Python 3.7.3. It allows the user to select a file extension they wish to target and move all files with that certain extension from one directory to another.

## What I learned
* Tkinter and the creation of basic widgets.
* How to use tkinter in an object-oriented approach.
* The walk() function from the os module.
* The move() function from the shutil module.
